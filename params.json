Currently no menu CSS is saved,\r\n    but it is possible a future version will have this feature.\r\n* Checked with JSHint.\r\n* Works in Opera!\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**\r\n\r\n* A browser that supports `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`\r\n\r\n*There are probably still some bugs* - I wrote this a long time ago to use\r\npersonally. I haven't noticed any severe bugs, but I did some code cleanup\r\nbefore putting it onto GitHub.
